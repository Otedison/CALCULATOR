# CALCULATOR
# Basic Calculator Program ðŸ§®

A simple Python program that asks the user to input two numbers and a mathematical operation 
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).  
It then performs the operation and displays the result.

Enter the second number: 5
Enter an operation (+, -, *, /): +
10 + 5 = 15
